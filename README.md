# NeRF: Novel View Synthesis

A computer vision project implementing Neural Radiance Fields in PyTorch. Given posed images of a scene, the model learns a continuous radiance field and renders views from new camera positions.

**Project maintainer: Yawen Zheng**

## Implementation

- Coarse and fine NeRF MLPs, each configured with 8 hidden layers and 256 units per layer.
- Sinusoidal encodings for 3D positions and viewing directions.
- Stratified coarse sampling and inverse-CDF hierarchical importance sampling.
- Differentiable volume rendering with RGB reconstruction loss for both networks.
- Adam optimization, learning-rate decay, and 1,024 sampled rays per training step.
- Chunked network evaluation and rendering, checkpoint saving, and TensorBoard loss/PSNR logging.

## Setup

Use Python 3.9 or later. Install the dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The code chooses CUDA, Apple MPS, or CPU based on availability. Full training is compute intensive; runtime depends on the scene and hardware.

## Dataset

Download the Blender synthetic dataset (`nerf_synthetic`) linked from the [original NeRF repository](https://github.com/bmild/nerf). Place it under `data/nerf_synthetic/` at the repository root.

Each scene directory, such as `data/nerf_synthetic/lego/`, should contain `transforms_train.json`, `transforms_val.json`, `transforms_test.json`, and the corresponding image folders.

Supported scene names are `chair`, `drums`, `ficus`, `hotdog`, `lego`, `materials`, `mic`, and `ship`. Datasets, pretrained checkpoints, and rendered videos are not bundled.

## Train

Run commands from the `code/` directory:

```bash
cd code
python run.py --object lego --expname lego_nerf --no_reload
```

To enable validation during training:

```bash
python run.py --object lego --expname lego_nerf --no_reload --use_validation
```

Additional hyperparameters are defined in `code/params.py`.

## Render from a checkpoint

With the default coarse/fine configuration, training saves checkpoints to `logs/weights/fine/single/<scene>/`. Once that directory contains a compatible checkpoint, run:

```bash
cd code
python run.py --object lego --expname lego_nerf --render_only
```

Rendering reloads the latest checkpoint. By default it renders the dataset's test camera poses and writes a video under `logs/experiments/<experiment>/test_output_<step>/`.

## Monitor training

From the repository root:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/tensorboard
```
